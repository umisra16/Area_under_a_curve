# Area_under_a_curve
This was a test code that was meant to be used for the final project of a Calculus class. Nevertheless, it works with any number of data points on y axis, separated by constant intervals on the x-axis (dx). The code uses the classical Trapezoidal and Simpson's rule approaches to calculate the area under the curve.
